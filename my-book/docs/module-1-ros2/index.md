# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of AI-Powered Robotics! In this module, you'll learn about the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware that serves as the "nervous system" for modern robots. ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure that allows different parts of a robot to work together seamlessly.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental architecture of ROS 2 and its core concepts
- Create ROS 2 nodes that communicate using Topics and Services
- Write Python applications that integrate with ROS 2 using the rclpy library
- Model robot structures using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)
- Visualize robot models in standard ROS 2 tools

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three progressive chapters:

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Basics - Nodes, Topics, and Services
Learn the foundational concepts of ROS 2, including the publish-subscribe pattern and request-response communication.

### Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy
Apply your knowledge by creating functional Python programs that communicate using ROS 2.

### Chapter 3: Humanoid URDF Modeling
Understand how to describe robot structures in code and visualize them in simulation tools.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge (variables, functions, classes)
- Familiarity with using a command line interface
- A computer with ROS 2 Humble or newer installed ([installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html))

## Learning Approach

Each chapter in this module includes:

- **Clear Explanations**: Concepts are introduced with plain-language definitions before diving into technical details
- **Practical Examples**: Working code that you can run on your own system
- **Visual Aids**: Diagrams and visualizations to reinforce understanding
- **References**: Links to official documentation and peer-reviewed sources for deeper exploration

## Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 is the industry-standard middleware for robotics research and development. It's used in:

- Academic robotics labs worldwide
- Commercial autonomous vehicle development
- Industrial automation systems
- Humanoid robotics projects
- Space exploration robots

Understanding ROS 2 is essential for anyone serious about building intelligent robotic systems.
